This is contains the python scripts developed throughout my Dissertation. In order to keep this repository lightweight and focused on source code, External libraries and local environments were excluded.
if you want to run this yourself, you will need to install the following external libraries in Python:
-opencv-python 
-djitellopy 
-numpy 
-matplotlib
After this, configure the motion capture system, 
create a client server relationship using static IP addresses and command/data ports, 
run both the motion capture and natnet python clients to capture the drones position and then 
finally run any of the "Flight_Trajectory" files in the folder.
